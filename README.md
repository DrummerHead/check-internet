# check internet

So you don't have Internet right now (how u redding tis) and wanna know when it's coming back.

Use this. Open index.html in your browser and it will check duckduckgo.com every minute and if you see a duck, be happy.

EDIT: Sooo… you're gonna need some foresight on this one… 'cause if you ain't got no internet you can't download this. So download it now and keep it in your USB purse, aight? Peace.
